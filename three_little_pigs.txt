Once upon a time there was an old sow who had three little pigs, and as she had not enough for them to eat, she said they had better go out into the world and seek their fortunes.

Now the eldest pig went first, and as he trotted along the road he met a man carrying a bundle of straw. So he said very politely:

"If you please, sir, could you give me that straw to build me a house?"

And the man, seeing what good manners the little pig had, gave him the straw, and the little pig set to work and built a beautiful house with it.

Now, when it was finished, a wolf happened to pass that way; and he saw the house, and _he smelt the pig inside_.

So he knocked at the door and said:

"_Little pig! Little pig! Let me in! Let me in!_"

But the little pig saw the wolf's big paws through the keyhole, so he answered back:

"_No! No! No! by the hair of my chin chin chin!_" Then the wolf showed his teeth and said:

"_Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in._"
